   ```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Production Security
- Set strong SECRET_KEY in environment
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure CORS properly for your domain
- Implement rate limiting
- Use environment-specific API keys
- Regular security updates

### Data Privacy
- Document processing is done locally/server-side
- No financial data stored permanently
- API keys secured through environment variables
- User sessions managed securely

## 🛠️ Development
